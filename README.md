# recommend_challenges
This is for developing the model engine that recommends challenges.

Use 'python -m pipreqs.pipreqs' to generate the requirements.txt if the file is not there.

Run main.py to get recommendations for an arbitary user_id

The KNN is implemented in the ml-function/challenge_recommender file which is the integrated version because the KNN is not availiable here.
