163,"en","How to strengthen your knees","As a teenager I was as active as anyone my age can be in middle and high school. I played
soccer and basketball and swam competitively year round. I also refereed soccer matches
for extra cash that I saved for college. I did not lack any physical activity and my body was
in great shape.

What I did not think about was the strain and beating that my knees were taking during
those intense sprints and long runs. The summer between high school and college I started
to develop pain in both of my knees, which caused trouble when I tried to run 10 miles on a
weekend as a referee. I needed a diagnosis fast so I could continue to referee and play
soccer.

For my diagnosis, I went to a local therapy and sports medicine specialist where they
diagnosed me with patellar tendonitis, a common problem for many athletes as they get
older. Patellar tendonitis weakens the patellar tendon, which aids in stabilizing the patella.

https://www.healthline.com/health/patellar-tendonitis

In college, students should be as active and physically fit as they desire. This was not the
case for me originally. Patellar tendonitis had me out of commission trying to fix years of
damage. I want to share my plan that helped me overcome my knee injuries by
strengthening the patellar tendon.",168,"'/health/patellar-tendonitis':175B '10':109B 'activ':12B,53B,182B 'age':16B 'aid':168B 'also':35B 'anyon':14B 'athlet':156B 'basketbal':28B 'beat':71B 'bodi':56B 'case':193B 'cash':41B 'caus':102B 'colleg':46B,90B,177B 'commiss':203B 'common':152B 'competit':31B 'continu':125B 'could':124B 'damag':209B 'desir':188B 'develop':94B 'diagnos':146B 'diagnosi':120B,133B 'extra':40B 'fast':121B 'fit':185B 'fix':206B 'get':159B 'great':59B 'help':217B 'high':22B,87B 'injuri':222B 'intens':79B 'knee':5A,74B,100B,221B 'lack':50B 'local':138B 'long':82B 'mani':155B 'match':38B 'medicin':142B 'middl':20B 'mile':110B 'need':118B 'older':160B 'origin':196B 'overcom':219B 'pain':95B 'patella':172B 'patellar':149B,161B,165B,197B,226B 'physic':52B,184B 'plan':215B 'play':25B,129B 'problem':153B 'refere':36B,116B,127B 'round':33B 'run':83B,108B 'save':44B 'school':23B,88B 'shape':60B 'share':213B 'soccer':26B,37B,130B 'specialist':143B 'sport':141B 'sprint':80B 'stabil':170B 'start':92B 'strain':69B 'strengthen':3A,224B 'student':178B 'summer':85B 'swam':30B 'take':76B 'teenag':8B 'tendon':150B,162B,166B,198B,227B 'therapi':139B 'think':65B 'tri':106B,204B 'troubl':103B 'want':211B 'weaken':163B 'weekend':113B 'went':135B 'www.healthline.com':174B 'www.healthline.com/health/patellar-tendonitis':173B 'year':32B,207B"

225,"en","Test anxiety strategies","These are some of the most common sources of test anxiety:

Being unprepared. Knowing you have not put in enough time and effort into studying for the test is one source of anxiety. Cramming increases anxiety.

Past experience. Failing to succeed in the past may cause anxiety. Negative self-talk statements such as âI am never going to get this rightâ and âI donât know any of thisâ increase anxiety. Talk to yourself as you would to your dear friend you were trying to encourage. Positive self-talk is proven to reduce anxiety and increase success.

Fear of failure. You may fear disappointing parents, losing your scholarship, or not being able to live up to your own standards. Linking your academic performance to your self-worth may increase anxiety. A test is not a measurement of your value as a person.

Use the following tips to help manage your test anxiety.

118,"en","How to spend âdeadtimeâ more efficiently","The term ""dead time"" is misleading. The breaths of air we encounter in our ever busy lives, seem like they should be used for relaxation and fun. For the longest time, I believed this too. My breaks were filled with hanging out with friends and playing video games into the early hours of the morning. However, as I got older and life became more serious, I noticed a trend. When school would resume, I would find doing work to take way more effort than before. The work ethic habits I had painstakingly created over the last school year had to be made again. 

It was like the deadtime I enjoyed had set my brain into relaxation mode, and it had to be woken up. The summer after my 16th birthday, my parents encouraged me to find a job. Since pizza was my favorite food at the time, I thought it would be fun to get a job at a pizzeria. It was not. However, the transition back into school seemed easier than ever before, and I felt accomplished at the end of the summer. 

From that summer forward, I made sure to spend my breaks working and learning new skills. While relaxing and having fun is important, deadtime should not be seen as a time to do only that. Rather, deadtime should be seen as the time for opportunity and freedom to push towards dreams and aspirations. If you want to turn deadtime into something productive, great. My plan involves various ways you use deadtime to create good habits, learn new skills, and pursue intriguing interests.",123,"'16th':135B 'accomplish':184B 'air':16B 'aspir':243B 'back':173B 'becam':69B 'believ':39B 'birthday':136B 'brain':120B 'break':43B,201B 'breath':14B 'busi':22B 'creat':99B,263B 'dead':9B 'deadtim':4A,114B,214B,227B,249B,261B 'dream':241B 'earli':57B 'easier':177B 'effici':6A 'effort':89B 'encount':18B 'encourag':139B 'end':187B 'enjoy':116B 'ethic':94B 'ever':21B,179B 'favorit':149B 'felt':183B 'fill':45B 'find':82B,142B 'food':150B 'forward':194B 'freedom':237B 'friend':50B 'fun':33B,159B,211B 'game':54B 'get':161B 'good':264B 'got':65B 'great':253B 'habit':95B,265B 'hang':47B 'hour':58B 'howev':62B,170B 'import':213B 'interest':272B 'intrigu':271B 'involv':256B 'job':144B,163B 'last':102B 'learn':204B,266B 'life':68B 'like':25B,112B 'live':23B 'longest':36B 'made':108B,196B 'mislead':12B 'mode':123B 'morn':61B 'new':205B,267B 'notic':73B 'older':66B 'opportun':235B 'painstak':98B 'parent':138B 'pizza':146B 'pizzeria':166B 'plan':255B 'play':52B 'product':252B 'pursu':270B 'push':239B 'rather':226B 'relax':31B,122B,208B 'resum':79B 'school':77B,103B,175B 'seem':24B,176B 'seen':218B,230B 'serious':71B 'set':118B 'sinc':145B 'skill':206B,268B 'someth':251B 'spend':3A,199B 'summer':132B,190B,193B 'sure':197B 'take':86B 'term':8B 'thought':155B 'time':10B,37B,153B,221B,233B 'toward':240B 'transit':172B 'trend':75B 'turn':248B 'use':29B,260B 'various':257B 'video':53B 'want':246B 'way':87B,258B 'woken':129B 'work':84B,93B,202B 'would':78B,81B,157B 'year':104B"
